    I put this website together to help me learn about web development and
    data scraping, allowing me to practice dynamic data visualization. \n
    For years I've been interested in the NBA and taking boxscore data and
    finding a better way to visualize it.\n
    I hope you enjoy looking through the data, seeing some of the graphs and stats,
    and maybe even learning something new about the game.\n
    If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, please feel free to reach out: gjowl04@gmail.com!\n
