    I put this website together to help me learn about web development and
    data scraping, allowing me to practice dynamic data visualization.\n
    For years I've been interested in the NBA and taking boxscore data and
    finding a way to visualize it for myself\n
    Data is sourced from [NBA.com](https://www.nba.com/stats/leaders) going back to the 1996-97 season.\n
