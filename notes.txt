"""
This file is for taking notes on things that I have implemented from my analysis of data
from https://www.basketball-reference.com/.
"""

Once I am able to scrape data, the most important task:
Set this up so itâ€™s updating by the day

Then, this could be nice to have:
All in one statswatch website: will tell how far away someone is from a particular milestone,
refreshing daily

Similar to power rankings on nba.com, make weekly stats
 -best and worst in some stats per the week/month/etc.

2021/12/22: I started my first bit of scraping aiming to try to search for all point totals
on basketball-reference, but I couldn't find those numbers on there.

In my search for another website, I found this one:
https://basketball.realgm.com/nba/stats/2022/Totals/Qualified/points/All/desc/1/Regular_Season

It has all of the data from the seasons, and has current totals for every single player. If I
can't find another website to do with totals, I could just search through all datasets of
previous seasons and add them per player, then update per player:
I think the easiest there would be to have a list of all players all time, then just
add the data to their spot. That might be a really nice and easy way to do it, with each
player having a really nice dataframe of data?

LOL nevermind I just found that they actually have all of those stats in here!
https://basketball.realgm.com/nba/stats/Historical/Totals/Qualified/points/All/desc/1/Regular_Season

So I can try to read through this and keep it for all players, then just have to constantly update.
Alternatively, I can just read in this data from the website everyday (but I wonder how long that
would take everyday?)
This list also doesn't have years played (they have games played, but I think I'd want to look
more on a yearly basis to see year to year improvement)

Also this:https://www.nba.com/stats/players/box-outs/
nba.com actually has quite a wealth of data as well: point per possession, frequence of plays
including and ones and turnovers. They even have box out information! Now only if I could
find info on screen assists
