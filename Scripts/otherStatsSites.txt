    - May be the most favorable for me in terms of use
http://www.hoopsstats.com/basketball/fantasy/nba/home
    - data site that uses data from lineups.com
https://www.nbastuffer.com/
    - Has referee stats
https://www.nba.com/stats/
    - Has most of the advanced stats
    - terms of use don't permit use for a website
https://www.statmuse.com/nba
    - The site most similar to what I want in my own:
        - very clean and organized
        - made by the creator of basketball reference (?)
