"""
Right now I have 10 years worth of data, and I need to figure out what to do with it.

I'm going to look at some other 10 year analyses that people have done, and see if there's anything that
might be interesting for me to look at using machine learning.

I think even just kind of taking all of this data and putting it into a training algorithm could be fun,
just to see what it comes out with. Maybe best player throughout this time or something simple?
