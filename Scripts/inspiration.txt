So I haven't been very productive on this because I've been struggling too hard with
work. I'm having a lot of trouble getting the balance of learning and utilizing what
I've learned, and so recently I've reached a troubling point, where I'm so unsure what 
to do, that I kind of just do nothing. I learn little bits of things outside of work,
but nothing that will actually help me in work. And I figure out little things to do
during work (i.e. look at code that I should probably change but don't). And the reason
that I don't make the changes to the code is because I don't know what to do.

And so I need to get back on this: if I want to graduate well, I need to learn machine learning
as quickly as I can. So I need to get something going with this basketball stuff ASAP,
so that I'm inspired and have some ideas to follow through on with the work.

Below I'm adding a list of videos and links that should be inspiration for ideas,
future goals, and cool things that I found in reinspiring this learning experience:

Informative video for how nba data analysts are using machine learning to
get a better understanding of the NBA game through movements (each player
as a dot on the court). Using these spatiotemporal features, they've been
able to define how good certain plays (i.e. pick and rolls) or shots
(shot probability based on quality of the shot and shooter). 

Bubble charts are a good way to analyze (insert screenshot from 2022-6-30)
data between two datapoints and to look at variance. #TODO: find a good site to categorize and keep these basketball ideas in where I can embed images and videos and such
