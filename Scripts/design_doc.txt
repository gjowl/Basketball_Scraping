Overview
While watching basketball games, I usually think of data based analytical questions: 
    - How well does this rookie player compare to another well known player?
        - What are potential breakout players for the next year? How can I use this
        information to affect my understanding of drafting fantasy players? Can I 
        compare stats between players to see what kind of trajectory they may have?
    - How is a player's usage rate likely to change after getting a new teammate/
    with other players on the floor? 
        Bulls: How does adding Derozan and Lonzo basketball affect on Zach Lavine's?
        Spurs: Dejounte's usage rate without Derozan?
        Cavs: Garland without Sexton and Rubio after injuries?
    - What is this team's record when:
        - they shoot x% from 3? 
        - they make x 3s?
        - they outrebound a team by x?

After thinking of many questions that I feel like aren't answered in an easy to access
way for the public like myself, I decided to put in the effort to design my own website
for analyzing this data that people may be interested in.

Goal
Design a website that analyzes data and updates in real time (or at least by the end of a day).
Can't do a website with their data, BUT I can do a blog with stuff I find from it 
(and that blog could probably have analyzed data; if not, I'll likely check terms of service for nba.com or espn)

Spotrac.com has contract data!

Design
Make it easy to navigate to interesting data:
    - Have a page with each team that highlights some of the interesting datapoints for players:
        Offense:
        - Highest usage rate
        - 
        Defense: 
        - # deflections per game
        - 
        Team:
        - # deflections
        - comparison in points, defense, etc. to all other teams 
    - Has tabs to remove or open bits of data easily so you don't have to scroll for too long
    - Advanced stats tab

Methods
Analyze data from open source parties:
    - https://www.basketball-reference.com/
    - https://www.nba.com/stats/

Using python Beautiful Soup package to scrape these websites for data, and save that
information externally: https://realpython.com/beautiful-soup-web-scraper-python/

Classes
year - holds statistics for 1 year of players career (hash? df?)
player - holds all of the year statistics for the length of a player's career

TODO: will likely need more for this
team - holds team data

Undecided:
Ads?
Subscription for more advanced data? Maybe if I actually get the ML stuff working well
